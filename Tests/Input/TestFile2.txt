The rain began as a gentle drizzle,
tiny droplets pattering softly against the windows.
The sound grew steadier,
a rhythmic tapping that seemed to echo the heartbeat of the earth.
Each drop traced a winding path down the glass,
forming a mosaic of fleeting patterns.

The scent of wet earth filled the air,
a rich, grounding aroma that stirred a sense of nostalgia.
Outside, the streets shimmered under the dim glow of streetlights,
their surfaces reflecting golden pools of light.
The world seemed to slow,
wrapped in a soothing veil of rainfall.

In the distance, a lone figure walked,
umbrella in hand,
their steps splashing softly through shallow puddles.
The sound of laughter drifted faintly from a nearby café,
its warmth cutting through the cool evening air.

Moments like these carried a quiet magic,
a reminder of life’s delicate balance
between motion and stillness.
The rain, constant and unhurried,
seemed to whisper secrets to those willing to listen,
inviting them to pause, breathe,
and simply exist in the present.
